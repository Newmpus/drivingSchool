# Payment Status and Verification Display Fix

## Issue Description
- After admin approves a student's payment, the payment status should update from "pending" to "approved".
- The payment verified indicator should show a checkmark when verified, not an "x".

## Current State
- Approval logic in `core/views/payment_views.py` and `core/admin.py` correctly sets `payment_status='approved'` and `payment_verified=True`.
- Templates display `payment_verified` as "True"/"False" text.
- Django admin shows checkmark for True, "x" for False in BooleanField.

## Plan
1. Update templates to show icons for payment_verified (checkmark for True, x for False).
2. Ensure `payment_approved_at` is set during approval.
3. Add refresh mechanism or confirmation after approval.
4. Test the approval process.

## Files Edited
- [x] `core/templates/admin/student_detail.html`: Updated to show icons for payment_verified and badges for payment_status.
- [x] `core/admin.py`: Added `payment_approved_at=timezone.now()` in approve_users action.
- [x] `core/templates/admin/payment_list.html`: Added approved status badge.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test approval from payment list.
- [ ] Test approval from admin interface.
- [ ] Verify status updates correctly.
- [ ] Confirm icons display properly.

## Additional Changes
- [x] Removed "Approve for VID" checkbox from "Lessons Needing Progress Comments" panel in dashboard.html (as per user request).
