# CHAPTER 4: DESIGN PHASE

---

## 4.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents the comprehensive design of the Driving School Management System (DSMS). The design phase encompasses the systematic approach to creating a robust web-based platform that streamlines driving school operations, including student management, lesson scheduling, payment processing, and administrative oversight. The design follows modern software engineering principles, emphasizing scalability, security, and user experience.

## 4.2 SYSTEM DESIGN

### 4.2.1 System Overview

The DSMS is designed as a three-tier web application following the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture pattern, Django's implementation of MVC. The system architecture consists of:

- **Presentation Layer:** Django templates with responsive HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript  
- **Business Logic Layer:** Django views and business logic implemented in Python  
- **Data Access Layer:** Django ORM with SQLite database (production-ready for PostgreSQL)  

> **Screenshot Placeholder 4.2.1:**  
> Capture the project folder structure highlighting core app, templates, static files, and main Django files.  
> Include screenshots of key files representing each MVT layer:  
> - `core/models.py` (Data Layer)  
> - `core/views/auth_views.py` (Business Logic Layer)  
> - `core/templates/dashboard.html` (Presentation Layer)  

### 4.2.2 Technology Stack

- Backend Framework: Django 4.x with Python 3.x  
- Frontend Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Database: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)  
- Task Queue: Celery with Redis for asynchronous processing  
- Web Server: Django development server / Gunicorn (production)  
- Static Files: WhiteNoise for production deployment

# Testing Recommendations

Before finalizing, consider testing these critical areas:

- User registration, login, and profile editing forms  
- Lesson booking, rescheduling, and cancellation flows  
- Payment proof upload and admin verification  
- Dashboard views and notifications for all user roles  
- Admin panel functionalities  

Would you prefer **critical-path testing** (key features only) or **thorough testing** (complete coverage)? Also, confirm if testing should focus on affected UI pages or the entire application.
